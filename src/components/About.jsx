        <p>
          I am 20 years old and I live in the city of Buenos Aires. I am a fan
          of video games and sports in general. As a Developer, I
          excel at designing and maintaining responsive websites that offer a
          seamless user experience. My experience lies in creating dynamic and
          attractive interfaces by writing clean and optimized code and using
          cutting-edge development tools and techniques, where said applications
          are supported by a robust backend, using the best development and
          validation practices.
